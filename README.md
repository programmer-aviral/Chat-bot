# Chat-bot
This project is a simple yet powerful chatbot built using Python. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries in real-time. The goal is to demonstrate how a basic conversational AI system can be created using Python with minimal dependencies and maximum customizability.
üöÄ Features
Text-based conversation with the bot

Easy to train with custom data

Modular design for integrating APIs or databases

Optionally extendable with GUI or web interface (e.g., Flask, Streamlit)

Lightweight and beginner-friendly

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3

NLTK / ChatterBot / Transformers (depending on version)

Regex for basic NLP tasks

Flask or Tkinter (for UI, optional)

If you tell me more about your chatbot (e.g., is it rule-based, AI-powered, does it use any frameworks like Flask or Streamlit?), I can tailor the description even better for your GitHub README.
